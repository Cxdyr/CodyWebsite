        <h2>Skills and Application</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic journey at Old Dominion University, I've had the opportunity to learn and apply a wide range of programming languages and skills. For example:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>C++:</strong> Learned in the context of Data Structures and Algorithms courses, where I developed a strong understanding of memory management, pointers, and complex data manipulation. Applied in projects like the Hemorrhagic Smallpox Simulator to model the spread of the disease through an interconnected population using lists of pointers.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Java:</strong> Used extensively in Object-Oriented Programming and Software Engineering courses, where I focused on building modular, reusable code. Developed several projects that emphasized design patterns and software architecture.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Python:</strong> Applied in Data Science and Professional Workforce Development courses, as well as personal projects like data analysis and automation scripts. <br><br>
            
            <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript:</strong> Developed front-end web applications in Web Development courses and personal projects, including FlixPicks. Gained experience in responsive design, user interface (UI) development, and dynamic content management.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Linux:</strong> Gained experience through coursework involving Operating Systems and Unix, where I learned command-line operations, shell scripting, and system administration. Used Linux environments for programming and project development.<br><br>
            
            <strong>API Integration:</strong> Implemented in projects such as FlixPicks, where I integrated third-party APIs (like TMDB) to create functional front-end applications. This involved fetching and manipulating data from external sources to enhance user experience.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Applied extensively in Java and C++ projects, focusing on class design, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Developed complex software systems with maintainable and scalable architecture.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Data Structures:</strong> Explored through C++ and Java courses, where I worked with linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Applied these concepts in algorithmic challenges and in projects like Card Factory, Hemorrhaic Smallpox Simulator, and numerous other smaller projects.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Algorithms:</strong> Studied in courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms, where I implemented and analyzed various algorithms for sorting, searching, and optimization. Used algorithmic strategies in problem-solving during competitions and projects.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Learned the fundamentals of process management, memory management, and file systems. Practical experience gained through implementing simulations of OS functions and working with Unix for Programmers.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Applied in Software Engineering projects, where I used frameworks like JUnit for Java to ensure code reliability and correctness. Focused on test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Virtualization & Docker:</strong> Explored the concepts of virtualization in Operating Systems courses and practiced containerization using Docker in FlixPicks and personal projects. Used these tools to create isolated environments for software development and testing.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Enhanced through courses like Theoretical Computer Science and participation in coding competitions, where I tackled complex problems using a variety of programming languages and algorithmic approaches.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Developed skills in creating web applications that work across different devices and screen sizes. Used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a consistent user experience on both mobile and desktop platforms.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Version Control:</strong> Gained proficiency with Git/GitHub in collaborative projects, ensuring code management, version tracking, and collaborative workflows were maintained efficiently.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Software Development:</strong> Engaged in full-stack development projects, where I applied the software development lifecycle (SDLC) principles, from requirements gathering and design to implementation and testing.<br>
