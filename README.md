# CodyRabie_Website
This is a basic webpage created using HTML, Python, JS, and CSS styling to implement my [CodyChatBOT](https://github.com/Cxdyr/CodyChatBOT) in a cool usable way paired with my resume and other information about myself.  
At the time of this commit it is a work in progress as I plan to add other cool features and changes. It uses Flask and the above requirements list. 
The deployed website via heroku is here: [CodyRabie-Portfolio-Website](https://cody-r-de7fa4f74335.herokuapp.com/)
